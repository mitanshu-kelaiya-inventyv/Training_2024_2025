# Flowcharts - Task 1

This repository contains C programs and commented JavaScript code representing flowchart-based solution. Each file demonstrates the implementation of a specific program based on the corresponding flowchart.

## Folder Structure

- `Area_of_Circle.c`: Calculates the area of a circle given its radius.
- `Factorial.c`: Computes the factorial of a number.
- `Max_of_three.c`: Determines the maximum value among three numbers.
- `Max_of_two.c`: Determines the maximum value between two numbers.
- `Perimeter_of_Circle.c`: Calculates the perimeter (circumference) of a circle given its radius.
- `Print_1_to_N.c`: Prints numbers from 1 to N.
- `Series_1.c`: Prints series: **1 -2 3 -4 5 -6 ....**.
- `Series_2.c`: Prints series: **1! 3! 5! 7! 9! ....**.
- `Series_3.c`: Prints series: **1! -3! 5! -7! 9! ....**.
- `Series_4.c`: Prints series: **1 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 4...**.
- `Series_5.c`: Prints series: **1 1 2 1 1 2 3 2 1 1 2 3 4 3 2 1...**.
- `sine.c`: Computes the sine of an angle by implementing Taylor Series.
- `Sum_of_one_to_N.c`: Calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to N.

## Flowcharts

- You can access flowcharts via: [FigJam]((https://www.figma.com/board/Q4PdnD7snWG3TRdxtzDq7R/Flowcharts?t=tk5c3z6sQwHZoxec-0))

## Features

- **Flowchart-based solutions**: Each program corresponds to a flowchart that helps visualize the logic behind the solution.
- **Commented JavaScript code**: Inside the C files, JavaScript implementations are included as comments for additional reference and comparison.

## Prerequisites

- Install a C compiler such as GCC to run the C programs.
- For JavaScript examples, any modern browser or Node.js environment can execute the commented code.

## How to Use

1. Copy the code.
2. Open any `.c` file to view the implementation.
3. Compile and run the C program using your preferred compiler:
   ```bash
   gcc <filename>.c -o <output_name>
   ./<output_name>
