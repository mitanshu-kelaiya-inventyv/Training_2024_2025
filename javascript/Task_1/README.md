## Overview
### This program demonstrates the use of JavaScript features such as IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression), Promises, and array manipulation methods like shift() and unshift(). It performs a calculation based on the sum of numbers in arrays and resolves or rejects a promise depending on the result.

## Key Concepts Used
- IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)
- Array Methods (shift and unshift)
- Promises

## How to Run
1. Copy the code into a JavaScript file.
2. Run the file in a Node.js environment or a browser console.
3. Observe the output in the console.
