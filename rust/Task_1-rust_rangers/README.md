# Game Title: Rust Rangers: Code of the Wild

## Concept Overview:

- The player takes on the role of a Rust Ranger, exploring a vast, dangerous wilderness while solving coding puzzles to advance. The game is designed to teach basic programming concepts in Rust through interactive challenges, each representing a specific area of programming (loops, functions, memory management, etc.).

## Game Structure:

- Storyline: The player’s mission is to restore balance to a once-thriving world by fixing malfunctioning code structures in nature (e.g., buggy animals, broken machines, and corrupted forests). Each area of the world introduces a new programming concept.

- Levels: The game is divided into different regions, with each region focusing on specific Rust concepts:

	1. The Forest of Variables: Introduction to variables, types, and mutability.
	2. Loops of the River: Teaches loops (for, while), iterators, and conditionals.
	3. Mountains of Memory: Focuses on Rust's memory management, borrowing, and ownership.
	4. The Dark Mines of Errors: Error handling using Result and Option.
	5. Fields of Structs and Enums: Teaches struct and enum types, pattern matching.

## Gameplay Mechanics:

- Interactive Coding Puzzles: Players must write small pieces of Rust code to progress through levels. Each puzzle is tailored to teach a specific programming concept, such as fixing an animal's movement by adjusting variables or managing resources by handling ownership correctly.

- Hints and Feedback: As the player writes code, they’ll receive real-time feedback on errors, explaining concepts like ownership, borrowing, and mutability in a simple, engaging way.

- Rust Ranger Abilities: The player unlocks special abilities (like coding shortcuts or extra tools) by mastering certain concepts, which help them solve more advanced puzzles later.

## Learning Focus:

- Syntax and Concepts: The game gradually introduces the player to Rust’s syntax, concepts like ownership and borrowing, pattern matching, and error handling.
- Problem-Solving: Puzzles are designed to enhance problem-solving skills by teaching how to think like a Rust developer, focusing on efficient, safe code.
